TO-DO List Application
 
You are expected to develop a fullstack to-do list application with using React/Angular/Vue in frontend and a backend project with any technology you want.
Back-end and front-end should be separated applications and connected to each other with REST APIs.
 
Expected features are;
- User registration
- User login
- Create to-do list. Each user will be able to have multiple to-do lists. Each to-do list will have a name.
- List of to-do lists.

- Add dependency between to-do items. To-do items which have dependency can not be completed if dependent to-do item is not completed.
- Each to-do item should have a name, description, deadline, and status.
- Mark to-do item as "Complete".
- Filter to-do items (status complete or not, expired, name) on a to-do list
- Order to-do items on a to-do list by create date, deadline, name, or status.
- Delete to-do item from to-do list.
 
General Expectations,

- Please use your favorite package manager for front-end and back-end libraries.
- Implement at least 3 unit tests.
- Please provide a documentation to explain install and run.
- Please share your project as a packaged file or via github.
 
Good Luck.
